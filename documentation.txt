while the system has the structure to support real-time operations, it's currently using test/dummy data. Here's a detailed breakdown:
Database Structure:
The User model (src/models/User.ts) has the proper hierarchy structure with:
Roles (Agent, Executive, ZM, AGM, Management)
Relationships (supervisor field)
Zone, area, and sub-area fields
But it's not fully populated with your 480 agents structure
Sales Data:
The Sale model (src/models/Sale.ts) has proper structure for:
Real-time sales tracking
Milk type tracking
Quantity management
But currently using test data
Current Limitations:
The setup-users route (src/app/api/auth/setup-users/route.ts) only creates test users
The sales API (src/app/api/sales/route.ts) is using a test user ID
Pages like ZM dashboard (src/app/zm/page.tsx) use hardcoded example data
Management page (src/app/management/page.tsx) shows static statistics
What's Missing for Real-Time Operation:
Proper User Setup:
Need to set up all 480 agents
Configure 24 executives (4 under each ZM)
Set up 6 ZMs
Configure AGM and management users
Establish proper hierarchical relationships
Real Data Integration:
Replace dummy data with real database queries
Implement proper data aggregation for different hierarchy levels
Set up real-time data synchronization
Access Control:
Implement proper role-based access control
Configure zone/area-based data filtering
Set up proper supervisor-subordinate relationships
To make this system work in real-time with your actual structure:
Database Setup Needed:
Create proper user hierarchy setup script
Configure all user relationships
Set up proper zone assignments
Code Updates Needed:
Update API routes to use real data
Implement proper data filtering based on roles
Add real-time data synchronization
Add proper authentication and authorization
Features to Add:
Real-time sales data aggregation
Proper hierarchical reporting
Zone-based access control
Real-time notifications
Currently, while the system has the basic structure, it's operating with dummy data and needs significant work to handle your actual scale of 480 agents and the complete hierarchical structure in real-time.     Replace the mockUserRole, mockZoneNumber, and mockAreaNumber with actual values from your authentication context
Connect the data fetching functions to your actual API endpoints
